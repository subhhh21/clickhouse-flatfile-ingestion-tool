# ClickHouse & Flat File Data Ingestion Tool

This is a Python-based application to ingest data from ClickHouse and flat files. The tool facilitates bidirectional data transfer, with a frontend UI for user interaction, JWT authentication, and data transfer reporting.

## Features
- **Bidirectional Data Ingestion**: Transfer data from ClickHouse to flat files and vice versa.
- **Frontend UI**: A simple, responsive UI to interact with the tool.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure the tool with JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication.
- **Column Selection**: Users can select columns to be ingested or transferred.
- **Data Transfer Reporting**: Track the status of data transfers.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Docker (for ClickHouse)
- Flask (Web framework)
- ClickHouse Client Library (clickhouse-connect)
- Other required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/clickhouse-ingestion-ui.git
cd clickhouse-ingestion-ui
2. Set up a Virtual Environment
It's recommended to set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
3. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages.

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run Docker for ClickHouse
You need to run the ClickHouse container. Execute the following command to start the ClickHouse server:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -d --name clickhouse-server -p 8123:8123 -p 9000:9000 clickhouse/clickhouse-server
5. Configure the Application
In the config.py file, set up the following:

ClickHouse: Provide your ClickHouse server’s host, port, user, and password.

JWT Secret: Set the secret key for JWT authentication.

python
Copy
Edit
CLICKHOUSE_HOST = 'localhost'
CLICKHOUSE_PORT = 8123
CLICKHOUSE_USER = 'default'
CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD = 'password'

JWT_SECRET_KEY = 'your-secret-key'
6. Run the Application
Now, you can run the Flask application:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
The application will start running at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

7. Access the Frontend
Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to interact with the UI.

Testing
To test the application:

Access the frontend.

Provide the necessary credentials (via JWT).

Choose the data sources (ClickHouse or flat file) and begin ingestion.

Monitor the data transfer status and report.

Troubleshooting
Common Errors
Error 500: If you encounter a server error, check the logs for details.

Connection Refused: Ensure the ClickHouse container is running and accessible.

Docker Issues
If you see errors related to Docker container startup, ensure that Docker is properly installed and running on your machine.
